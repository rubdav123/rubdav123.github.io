Mbappé has been named Ligue 1 Player of the Year a record five times, and has finished as the Ligue 1 top scorer for a record six seasons; in the 2021–22 season, he became the first player to finish as both Ligue 1 top scorer and top assist provider. Mbappé was named as one of the Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2023 and was listed by Forbes as one of the world's ten highest-paid athletes in 2023 and 2024.Early lifeKylian Mbappé Lottin[3] was born on 20 December 1998[4] in the 19th arrondissement of Paris[5] and was raised in Bondy, Seine-Saint-Denis, in the northeastern suburbs of Paris.[6] His father, Wilfrid Mbappé, is a football coach and is originally from the Cameroonian island of Djébalè [fr],[7] which is home to the Sawa people. His mother and agent, Fayza Lamari, is of Algerian Kabyle origin and is a former handball player.[8][9][10][11] He has a younger brother, Ethan, who plays for Lille.[12][13] Their older adoptive brother, Jirès Kembo Ekoko, is a former professional footballer.[14]As a child, Mbappé went to a private Catholic school in Bondy, where he was considered academically gifted but unruly.[15] At 15, he began taking Spanish lessons, and eventually became fluent in the language.[16] Among Mbappé's idols growing up were Zinedine Zidane,[17] Cristiano Ronaldo,[18] Neymar,[19] Ronaldinho,[20] Lionel Messi,[19] Ronaldo Nazario,[21] Eden Hazard[22] and Thierry Henry.[23][24] As a child, Mbappé received Robinho's AC Milan shirt as a gift from his nanny's family, who were Italians and supporters of the club.[25][26] However, his own favourite team had always been Real Madrid.[27] In May 2024, just days before his transfer to Real Madrid was announced, Mbappé said that he still follows Serie A and AC Milan, and would like to play for the Rossoneri if he is ever to move to Italy in the future.[28]Club careerEarly careerMbappé was coached by his father, Wilfried, when he started his career with AS Bondy. Another of his youth coaches at AS Bondy, Antonio Riccardi, stated,The first time I coached him was when he was six years old. You could tell he was different. Kylian could do much more than the other children. His dribbling was already fantastic and he was much faster than the others. He was the best player I've ever seen in 15 years coaching here. In Paris, there are many talents but I'd never seen a talent like him. He was what we call a 'crack' (the best).[29]</p>
